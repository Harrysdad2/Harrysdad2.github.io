# Art Deco Window

I was asked by my Dad to do a window for an extension to his house. The window faces the driveway and he wanted something that he could see enough through to know if someone was there, but to reduce the view into the house. I chose to do another sunburst and borrowed the bluebird design from our own home. It's better than net curtains!

The construction is a mix of tiffany (copper tape and solder) and lead construction. The lower clear glass is fairly heavily obscured and the upper part is slightly wavy clear glass to give the level of visibility that Dad wanted. The ground on the bottom right has nuggets and slices of geode set into a metal sheet and textured with solder. You can spot off-cuts from the Green Man window and glass from the galleon too!
