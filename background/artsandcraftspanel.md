# Arts & Crafts Panel

My sister and her husband were both 60 within a month of each other in Autumn 2021 so I decided to make them a panel as a gift. I knew that they wanted something that could stand on a base on a window sill. Knowing their likes, I decided to use influences from Clarice Cliffe and from the windows at [Blackwell House](https://lakelandarts.org.uk/blackwell/the-experience/){:target="_blank"} in Windermere, Cumbria. 

The birds and the crocuses were constructed using copper foil/solder and the whole piece was leaded, with a 6mm round c-section came to the edge. The biggest challenge was the reamy clear background. All of the seperate pieces of clear glass were cut out of the sheet so that the lines were maintained through the finished art with the intention that they give a sense of movement, particularly to the birds.

The base is a piece of reclaimed oak routed, sanded and oiled. the support is a length of mild steel bar bent to shape, epoxied into the base and then laquered. The aim was to try not to obscure the piece with the stand.The finished panel is about 10" wide and 14" tall.
