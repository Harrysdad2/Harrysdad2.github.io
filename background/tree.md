# Tree

Following an idea from an american book, I made a tree as a piece of wall art. The glass is all a hammered seedy clear glass and, except for the edge, it is constructed using copper foil and solder. The tree trunk and branches are filled with scrap lead and soldered. The smallest branches are copper wire and the copper leaves were added at the end. This is a very heavy item and needed substantial wall fixings to ensure it stays secure. The tree is approximately 400mm x 400mm.
