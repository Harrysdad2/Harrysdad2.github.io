# Bluebird

We live in a 1930s semi-detatched house which had a number of stained glass windows. Some of them were in metal frames which had rusted badly and cracked some of the glass. There was a long metal-framed window on the staircase with a bluebird at the top and a galleon at the bottom. The frame had badly rusted and most of the galleon was beyond repair. The window was also incredibly cold! We took the decision to remove the window and replace it with a new double-glazed unit. I removed all of the glass, preserving most of it for future use, and kept the bluebird for a new project.

The sunburst is all cut from a single sheet of glass, choosing the light and darker parts for each ray as appropriate. This is made using lead came throughout and hangs on sturdy chains in front of a new window on the same elevation of the house as it was originally. It catches the morning sun and always brightens the day.
