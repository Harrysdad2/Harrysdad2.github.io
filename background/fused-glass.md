# Fused Glass

In early 2016 I did one of Jo-Ann’s one day taster sessions in fused glass at Hannah Stained Glass{:target="_blank"}. In addition to good food and company, I learnt how to use glass sheet, powders and frits (like glass gravel) to make an object. Using a base of clear glass, you build up a picture which is then fused in Jo-Ann’s kiln. There is a lot of science to it and a whole load of different techniques but the process is fun and very therapeutic. 



My wife sews. She love patchwork, piecework and quilting. For our 29th wedding anniverary in September 2020 I decided to make a fused glass piece in a pattern she has used a number of times called 'Family tree' by Kellie Wulfsohn. The tree trunk was made up of small pieces of a brown/cream glass laid like a mosaic and the leaves were cut from a wide variety of fusible glass. The four birds, two blue, two pink, represent our family. The pictures below show a quilted cushion and my interpretation in glass!
