# Fused Glass



My wife sews. She love patchwork, piecework and quilting. For our 29th wedding anniverary in September 2020 I decided to make a fused glass piece in a pattern she has used a number of times called 'Family tree' by Kellie Wulfsohn. The tree trunk was made up of small pieces of a brown/cream glass laid like a mosaic and the leaves were cut from a wide variety of fusible glass. The four birds, two blue, two pink, represent our family. The pictures below show a quilted cushion and my interpretation in glass!
