# Workshop

There are two windows in my shed, both with nine panes of glass. I’ve used one of these for a few bits and pieces of glasswork – mainly to try out ideas.

First up is another bluebird. This was inspired by the windows at [Blackwell](https://lakelandarts.org.uk/blackwell/){:target="_blank"}, the Arts & Crafts house at Windermere. Well worth a visit if you’re over that way!

The small tree was a tester for the larger one that is In our house.

Top right is a horse-chestnut leaf which the kids think is cannabis(!)

Bottom left is a panel just made of random bits of glass. I tried to do as much of this as possible without cutting. It’s a bit odd but was fun to do.

Finally bottom right is a pink and blue panel. This was constructed using both copper foil and lead and the glass was a single hobby sheet of opal glass. I tried to cut the various pieces to create a very loose impression of a Monet bridge. In this case the different lead widths form part of the picture rather than the boundary to each piece of glass.
