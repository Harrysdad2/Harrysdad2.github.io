# Privacy Panel

At the rear of our house we have a bay window. Much as we love our neighbours, the side window looks out across the back of their house. To provide a little privacy, for both of us, I made a panel to hang in the lower part of the window (think net curtains...). This panel was inspired by windows in the house at [Cragside](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/north-east/cragside){:target="_blank"} in Northumberland. The upstairs landing wraps around a small courtyard which is full of drainage pipes etc. The windows let a good deal of light in but completely obscure the functional outside workings. I was particularly attracted by the way that the clear reeded glass reflects different colours depending on the angle of the reeds. The panel below is made of clear glass, but the picture shows how the glass picks up the colours of the sky, trees, houses etc beyond.
