# Obelisks

{: .warning }
TODO write some introduction about obelisks

{: .notice }
Maybe add some pictures or a collage

You can see the full list of obelisks I have made in the sidebar and at the bottom of this page - click to go through and see some pictures!

## Commissions

I’d love to make more of these obelisks and would welcome enquiries to [andysglass252@gmail.com](mailto:andysglass252@gmail.com). An obelisk typically costs between £200 and £400 plus transport, depending on the size, complexity and degree of work required.
