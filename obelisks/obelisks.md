# Obelisks



I’ve always liked the stained glass art where glass is set into a large piece of driftwood and stood vertically in the ground.

The roofs of the houses we live in have a big heavy timber ridge beam that’s about 11”x 3” cross section. When lofts are converted, the beam is removed and replaced with a steel beam. I thought that a length of this beam could be used with a piece of stained glass and be shaped (carved, even) to be a little more interesting. 

The first obelisk was a success - with a great deal of learning! As time has gone on I have developed ways of working. Check out the 'How It's Done' section for more details.

## Commissions

I’d love to make more of these obelisks and would welcome enquiries to [andysglass252@gmail.com](mailto:andysglass252@gmail.com). An obelisk typically costs between £200 and £500 plus transport, depending on the size, complexity and degree of work required.
