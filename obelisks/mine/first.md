# The First Obelisk

{: .warning }
TODO check

The roofs of the houses we live in have a big heavy timber ridge beam that’s about 11”x 3” cross section. When lofts are converted, the beam is removed and replaced with a steel beam.

I’ve always liked the stained glass art where glass is set into a large piece of driftwood and stood vertically in the ground. I thought that a length of this beam could be used with a piece of stained glass and be shaped (carved, even) to be a little more interesting. I obtained a few lengths from local houses (with permission!) and set to work on making an obelisk.

A quick sketch and a sunny afternoon spent laying out lots of bits of glass led to a ‘rainbow’ panel. A few hours spent with an assortment of power tools left me with an hole in the wood and some shaping around the edges. It’s amazing how much mess you can make with a sanding disc on an angle grinder!
The finished article sits in our garden where it provides a focal point and catches the late afternoon sun.
