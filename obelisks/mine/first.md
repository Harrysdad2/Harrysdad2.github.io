# The First Obelisk

{: .warning }
TODO check

Made from a reclaimed timber ridge beam that’s about 11”x 3” cross section. The houses were built in the 1930s and the timber is pitch pine.

A quick sketch and a sunny afternoon spent laying out lots of bits of glass led to a ‘rainbow’ panel. A few hours spent with an assortment of power tools left me with an hole in the wood and some shaping around the edges. It’s amazing how much mess you can make with a sanding disc on an angle grinder!
The finished article sits in our garden where it provides a focal point and catches the late afternoon sun.
