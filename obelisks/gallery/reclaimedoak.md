# Reclaimed Oak

This obelisk is for indoors and has glass set into an old oak beam. I had a stainless steel base made so that it stands safely! I made a small horizontal piece from the centre wood and then made a candle holder from the final piece! These are now living in Aberdeenshire.

Working such old wood was a challenge because i wanted to retain as much of it's original character as possible. The sides were not square to each other and there were a selection of old handmade nails buried in it. It was finished by polishing with hard wax to give it a soft sheen without affecting the colour of the patina.
