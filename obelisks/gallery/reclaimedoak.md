# Reclaimed Oak

I was contacted by a lady asking if I would consider making a free-standing obelisk for indoors. She had a pretty clear idea â€“ reclaimed chunky oak, simple glass, about 4 feet tall. Of course, I like a challenge so I agreed to come up with some ideas and, if she liked them, she would consider a commission. I found a wonderful timber reclamation yard in Guiseley and came home with an old oak roof beam. Not cheap but still wonderful wood. 

Working such old wood was a challenge because i wanted to retain as much of it's original character as possible. The sides were not square to each other and there were a selection of old handmade nails buried in it. A little research suggested the nails were pre-1900 so we can guess that the beam was at least 120 years old. It was finished by polishing with hard wax to give it a soft sheen without affecting the colour of the patina.

I had a stainless steel base made so that it stands safely! I made a small horizontal piece from the centre wood and then made a candle holder from the final piece! These are now living in Aberdeenshire.
