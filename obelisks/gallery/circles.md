# Circles

Summer 2022 brought a commission for an obelisk with circles. This was geat fun to make and uses roundels, nuggets and some irridescent glass. All of the infill glass is the same to make the circles 'pop'! The client asked for this to be free-standing so I made a timber base that the obelisk slots onto. It now spends time in both the summerhouse and the garden.
