# Abstract

In July 2020 I was contacted by a lovely lady called Pam who wanted to commission an obelisk. Pam had a clear idea of what she was looking for so sketches were produced and an obelisk mocked up to allow us to agree on what was wanted. I absolutely loved making this panel and both Pam and I were pleased with the finished product. It was packed up and sent to her home via courier for installation in her garden.
