# Sunset



My second obelisk was made as payment to a good friend in exchange for her professional gardening/planting advice! For this one I chose to use a facetted jewel as the sun and create a ‘landscape’ in glass. This now sits in her gorgeous garden in north Leeds.

I then decided to make a simplified rectangular obelisk to try to sell. This one now resides in a peaceful garden used by a therapy centre in Sheffield.
