# Sea & Hills

This obelisk is probably the most ambitious to date. It was commissioned by the neighbour of the new owners of the Random Stripes obelisk as a present for her husband.

The design went through a number of iterations ending with a representation of sea, hils and mountains. The waves incude a hand-blown roundel and small glass nuggets.
