# Sea & Hills

This obelisk is probably the most ambitious to date. In Spring 2021 I was approached by a friend of my wife to design and make an obelisk for a 'significant birthday' for her husband. The initial brief was to do something that reflected a path, hills, mountains - possibly the lake district - maybe a sunburst?. A few sketches followed and the design evolved. We lost the path and the sunburst, then swapped the idea of a lake for the sea (Irish, choppy!). I chose a tapered oval shape and produced a full-size template. The glass included clear nuggets in the sea as well as a blue rondel. That was very thin so I backed it with a clear circle for strength.

The timber was a reclaimed ridge beam, as with my other work, and I shaped it using saws, planer, router and sanders. I chose to extend the hill lines into the wood to add a bit more interest.
