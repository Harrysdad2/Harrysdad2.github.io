# Butterflies

This is a set of four wingtips of British butterflies, Small Tortoiseshell, Peacock, Red Admiral and Painted Lady. Each piece is 100mm diameter and there are 105 pieces of glass between them. Some of the bits are just a couple of millimetres across!

Having made four separate suncatchers, I decided to combine them into a single panel.
