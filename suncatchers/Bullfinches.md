# Bullfinches

This commission was for a local resident who was regularly visited by a pair of Bullfinches to the feeders in his garden. I already had a sketch of a stylised bullfinch for an art deco panel being planned. It was a relatively easy step to move to a simplified version of a pair of birds. The real challenge was finding the right glass to properly match the colours of the birds' breasts.

The design is a 150mm diameter circle with branches and leaves behind the birds.
