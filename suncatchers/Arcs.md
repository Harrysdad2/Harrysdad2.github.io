# Arcs

This suncatcher is a design I have done a number of times at 100mm diameter. I was asked to make a larger one, at 150mm diameter, which was fun. I used a few bits of 'posh' glass including some blue/clear Baroque, pieces of handmade glass from Lamberts in Germany and a small piece of some hand-blown green/amber/clear glass from the long-gone Hartley Wood factory in Sunderland.
