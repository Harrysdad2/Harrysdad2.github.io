# Dreamcatcher

This commission was for a 50th birthday present and the request was to include feathers and a letter 'C'. I was also asked to provide a stand so that the recipient could display it on a stand or off a hook.

The design is based on a traditional dreamcatcher comprising 50 pieces of glass plus the 'C' with five small feathers hung below. The stand was a challenge given the weight of the piece but eventually took the form of a wooden base with a laquered steel hoop to hand the piece from.
