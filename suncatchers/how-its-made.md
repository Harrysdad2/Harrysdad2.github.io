# How It's Done

TODO write

I love making these small circular suncatchers. There are many suncatchers out there that are shaped as the subject matter and the patterns mean the finished suncatcher can be vulnerable to damage as a result. I like to fit the subject matter into a circle (or, in the case of Giraffe, an oval) with a lead came edge. It makes a nice strong item that will last many years. Most importantly for the market, these suncatchers can be sold at a price that is achievable to many people.

This section shows a step-by-step guide to making a 100mm diameter suncatcher.

Step 1 - the idea and sketch. In this case my intial ideas were to try to replicate the fronds typical of a fern. It quickly became apparent that there would be too many pieces of glass, so an alternative idea was explored.


Step 2 - the working design. This is used to transfer the shapes to the glass for cutting and assembly.


Step 3 - The glass is cut and the edges ground to ensure a good light fit.



Step 4 - Each piece of glass is wrapped in copper tape. Note that the edges of the circle are left uncovered as they will have the lead edge on later.



Step 5 - Using the pattern, the pieces are placed together and solder is used to tack them into place.



Step 6 - All joints are soldered on both side of the piece.



Step 7 - Using thin tinned copper wire, the detail is added with each point that touches a joint tacked into place using solder.



Step 8 - A bead of solder is then added along each joint, leaving a few millimeters at each joint on the edge of the circle. This is to allow the lead to be fitted without needing adjustment at each joint.



Step 9 - The C-section edge came is then bent into a circle and cut to length.
