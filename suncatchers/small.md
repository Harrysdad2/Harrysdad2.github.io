# Small Suncatchers

My small suncatchers are 100mm diameter. Below are a series of pictures of ones made to date. All of these can be made to order and most cost £30 to £40. A few of the very complex ones are a little more. If you have a specific subject in mind then contact me and I will see what I can do!
