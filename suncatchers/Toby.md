# Toby

This commission was for a piece to commemorate a much loved family pet, Toby. As a white Labradoodle, it was quite a challenge to find a way to represent white fur. Toby was known for wearing a rainbow bow tie on his collar so that was added to the design.

The suncatcher was 125mm in diameter with a 6mm c-section lead edge.
