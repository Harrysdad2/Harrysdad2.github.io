Having learned a few skills and gained a little confidence working with glass I saved up and purchased a decent glass cutter and a soldering iron. The iron is a Weller 100w hobby tool and has served me very well.

We live in a 1930s semi-detatched house which had a number of stained glass windows. The opening windows in the front bay were in metal frames which had rusted badly and cracked some of the glass. Having found frames that had been removed from the back of the house at the bottom of the garden(!) I removed the damaged frames, re-built the glass and welded new metal into the frames  (a legacy skill from doing up VW Beetles...). This added a decade or so onto the life of the bay window (with a few other repairs). 

The house also had a long metal-framed window on the staircase with a bluebird at the top and a galleon at the bottom. The frame had badly rusted and most of the galleon was beyond repair. The window was also incredibly cold! We took the decision to remove the window and replace it with a new double-glazed unit. I removed all of the glass, preserving most of it for future use, and kept the bluebird for a new project.

The sunburst is all cut from a single sheet of glass, choosing the light and darker parts for each ray as appropriate. This is made using lead came throughout and hangs on sturdy chains in front of a new window on the same elevation of the house as it was originally. It catches the morning sun and always brightens the day.

A small window using glass elements from the house was made to go in a window in my in-laws' house. This window faces a public footpath and the panel stops people from looking directly in to their house.
