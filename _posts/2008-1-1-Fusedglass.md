title: Fused Glass
---

In early 2016 I did one of Jo’s one day taster sessions in fused glass at [Hannah Stained Glass](https://www.hannahstainedglass.com/){:target="_blank"}. In addition to good food and company, I learnt how to use glass sheet, powders and frits (like glass gravel) to make an object. Using a base of clear glass, you build up a picture which is then fused in Jo’s kiln. There is a lot of science to it and a whole load of different techniques but the process is fun and very therapeutic. My piece of work was a representation of our house and garden.

Time rolled on and I decided I would like to try some more glass fusing, this time as a five session evening class. Jo structures the course so that beginners can produce a few items. I chose to make a curved candle light. My inspiration for this was a piece of Moorcroft pottery.

The first step is to get very messy using pastels to sketch a plan. This forms a template for the glass work – although invariably things change as you go along!

The first step was to lay down the background using cut glass and powders. This was put into the kiln for a full fuse, to completely melt the first elements together.

The elements forming the trees and the moon were then added and went back into the kiln for a partial fuse, to melt everything together but to retain some texture. Finally the finished flat piece was heated again to let it slump over a former to produce the bent shape that allows the glass to stand in front of a candle.

As a small project I made five discs in red, orange and yellow. As a bit of a test, I later fixed these into a small plank of beech wood (originally part of a drawing board) so it could stand on the windowsill in our sunny front room.

My final project for that first course was a beetle. Inspiration was a dung or scarab beetle…

Jo and I discussed how many layers of glass I could get away with. The conclusion was that it would either break or it wouldn’t! The beetle finally had six layers of glass plus decoration with four  lengths of copper wire sandwiched between layers 1 and 2 to provide the bases for the legs and antennae. As you can see, it didn’t break! I added copper legs and antennae using similar methods to the other bugs, plus a couple of loops to screw it down onto the handrail in the gazebo.

I enjoyed this course so decided to repeat the experience in February this year. My aim was to make a couple of triangular windows for the gazebo. The fish was formed using opalescent white powder for the body with clear oranges on top. The main challenge with this was that the powders for the orange glass all look white when you are using them… This was fully fused and then the water was created using small pieces of broken clear glass with blue powders over and between. Additional orange and black was added to the fish. This was partially fused to keep some texture.

Next up was a gecko, using the same techniques used on the fish. Unfortunately the pandemic lockdown stopped play so the gecko had to wait until July before I was able to finish it off. The final picture shows the two windows in place with a background of summer flowers.
