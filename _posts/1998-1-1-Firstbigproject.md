title: My First Big Project
---

In 1998/9 I took an evening class led by Jo-Anne from [Hannah Stained Glass](https://www.hannahstainedglass.com/){:target="_blank"}. The project for that was a new back door with a window approximately 650mm by 1050mm. The evening class was in a local high school so the project had to be taken home each week. The baseboard had to be cut so it just fitted in the car and the work-in-progress had to be leaned against the lounge wall every week. As it progressed it got heavier and heavier - it's amazing it survived!

The design is a green man with a heavily textured dark brown background to represent bark. The light and dark green 'leaves' are clear enough to see movement outside but obscured enough to give a clear view through the door.

Once complete, the window was fitted into the door against a sheet of laminated glass to provide strength and security. It's still there and looks as good as ever.
