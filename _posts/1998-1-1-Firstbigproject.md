title: My First Big Project
---

In 1998 I took an evening class led by Jo-Anne. The project for that was a new back doorwith a window approximately 650mm by 1050mm. The evening class was in a local high school so the project had to be taken home each week. The baseboard had to be cut so it just fitted in the car and the work-in-progress had to be leaned against the lounge wall every week. As it progressed it got heavier and heavier - it's amazing it survived!

The design is a green man with a heavily textured dark brown background to represent bark.

Once complete, the window was fitted into the door against a sheet of laminated glass to provide strength and security. It's still there and looks as good as ever.
