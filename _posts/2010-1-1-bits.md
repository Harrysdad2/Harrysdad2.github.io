This section is just a record of a few of the bits and bobs I have made.

Last Christmas I made a selection of tree ornaments which I sold to friends and on ebay.

Earlier this year I made a spider's web as a present. Another friend asked me to make one for her so I made a couple of extras at the same time to sell.

I had a sheet of dark grey glass so I also made a set of bats...

See the 'Stuff for Sale' page for more details.

A friend suffers from ME. This debilitating condition deeply affects her life but she manages to make jewellery which she sells through her Etsy shop [Beads and ME](https://https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/BeadsandMEJewellery/){:target="_blank"} . This piece is a representation of the blue ribbon that is used to mark ME awareness and was made using clear bright blue glass and opalescent white glass.
