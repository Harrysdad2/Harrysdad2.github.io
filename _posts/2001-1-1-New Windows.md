We live on quite a long road which shares its name with other roads in the city so it's important that people can see a house number when trying to find us. I designed the '252' in a deco style using transparent glass in clear and blue. The edge is in zinc came which provides a lightweight edge. There is a wire running through the frame to the hanging loops to provide additional strength.

I was also asked by my Dad to do a window for an extension to his house. The window faces the drivway and he wanted something that he could see enough through to know if someone was there, but to reduce the view into the house. I chose to do another sunburst and borrowed the bluebird design from our own home.

The construction is a mix of tiffany (copper tape and solder) and lead construction. The lower clear glass is fairly heavily obscured and the upper part is slightly wavy clear glass to give the level of visibility that Dad wanted. The gound on the bottom left has nuggets and slices of geode set into a metal sheet and textured with solder. You can spot off-cuts from the Green Man window and glass from the galleon too!

Following an idea from an american book, I also made a tree as a piece of wall art. The glass is all a hammered seedy clear glass and, except for the edge, it is constructed using copper foil and solder. The tree trunk and branches are filled with scrap lead and soldered. The smallest branches are copper wire and the copper leaves were added at the end. This is a ery heavy item and needed substantial wall fixings to ensure is stays secure.The tree is approximately 400mm x 400mm.
