title: Where it All Began
---

Back in 1996 I enroled in a short class to learn Stained Glass technique at [Hannah Stained Glass](https://www.hannahstainedglass.com/){:target="_blank"} in Leeds. That first class taught us how to cut glass and create a picture using the Tiffany method.

This free-hanging picture is inspired by the pottery by [Clarice Cliff](https://www.claricecliff.com/home){:target="_blank"}. It is made from various colours of hammered transparent glass which is then edged in copper tape and soldered together. The outer edge is a length of lead came with wire hoops soldered in to hang it from.
