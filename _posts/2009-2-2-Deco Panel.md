In October 2019 we took a short trip to Prague. Itâ€™s a beautiful city, well worth visiting. I have always liked the art of Alphons Mucha so a wander around the [museum](http://www.muchafoundation.org/){:target="_blank"} was a must. We also took a tour around the [Municipal House](https://www.prague.eu/en/object/places/417/municipal-house-obecni-dum?back=1){:target="_blank"} which boasts Mucha-designed rooms and stained glass. One particular window caught my eye and, despite the bad light, I took some pictures for future reference. I was glad I did because images of the window on-line are very scarce!
