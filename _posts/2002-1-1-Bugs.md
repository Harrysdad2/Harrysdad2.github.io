title: Bugs!
---

Who doesn't like bugs and creepy crawlies? My first bug was a dragonfly, inspired by by a pair of blue glass nuggets that had been fused together. Using thin copper sheet and wire (re-purposed electrical wire) I fashioned a body and wings with the nuggets as eyes. It has a wingspan of about 300mm and was originally attached to a length of piano wire set into a concrete block so it could wobble in the breeze over our pond. More recently I have fixed it to a fibreglass pole (a re-purposed cat toy from Aldi) and it continues to decorate the pond as intended.

Bitten by the bug(!), I then made a spider in it's web. The body was made by a local lady who made jewellery. The legs were made of copper wire and thin copper sheet. The web was made out of electrical wire. The only maintenance to this little lady is an annual cutting back of the ivy to make sure she stays visible. She has a leg-span of approximately 150mm.

A set of damselflies followed from that. These have more glass in them but follow similar construction to the spider. The leaves are a length of old copper pipe, split and flattened before cutting to shape. They are weighed down with a rock and sway in the breeze. One of them lives in an exposed location in Saddleworth and had to have its wings reinforced to be able to stand up to the strong westerly winds!

My favourite is glasshopper... He sits in a clump of bamboo attached to a length of metal pipe painted to blend in.

The latest member of the family resulted from a fused glass course I took a couple of years ago. This beetle is loosely based on a scarab beetle and is about 100mm long. He is built of layers of glass fused together. I think he's really cool!

This one is not strictly a bug, but this fairy body had some butterfly wings that weren't particularly attractive. I removed them (gently) and designed and built a set of wings based on those normally found on a cicada. Each pair of wings is mounted on a length of stainless steel wire and soldered onto the back of the fairy's body. The addition of three hanging loops (one on each of the main wings and one near her bum) allow her to be suspended 'in-flight'.
