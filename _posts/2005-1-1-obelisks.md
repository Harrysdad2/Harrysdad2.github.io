The roofs of the houses we live in have a big heavy timber ridge beam that’s about 11”x 3” cross section. When lofts are converted, the beam is removed and replaced with a steel beam.

I’ve always liked the stained glass art where glass is set into a large piece of driftwood and stood vertically in the ground. I thought that a length of this beam could be used with a piece of stained glass and be shaped (carved, even) to be a little more interesting. I obtained a few lengths from local houses (with permission!) and set to work on making an obelisk.

A quick sketch and a sunny afternoon spent laying out lots of bits of glass led to a ‘rainbow’ panel. A few hours spent with an assortment of power tools left me with an hole in the wood and some shaping around the edges. It’s amazing how much mess you can make with a sanding disc on an angle grinder!
The finished article sits in our garden where it provides a focal point and catches the late afternoon sun.

My second obelisk was made as payment to a good friend in exchange for her professional gardening/planting advice! For this one I chose to use a facetted jewel as the sun and create a ‘landscape’ in glass. This now sits in her gorgeous garden in north Leeds.

I then decided to make a simplified rectangular obelisk to try to sell. This one now resides in a peaceful garden used by a therapy centre in Sheffield.

In July 2020 I was contacted by a lovely lady called Pam who wanted to commission an obelisk. Pam had a clear idea of what she was looking for so sketches were produced and an obelisk mocked up to allow us to agree on what was wanted. I absolutely loved making this panel and both Pam and I were pleased with the finished product. It was packed up and sent to her home via courier and is now awaiting final installation.

Two obelisks were commissioned in 2021 for local gardens:

The newest obelisk is for indoors and has glass set into an old oak beam. I made a small horizontal piece from the centre wood and then made a candle holder from the final piece! These are now living in Aberdeenshire.

I currently have a new obelisk for sale in my [Etsy shop.](https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/AndysGardenGlass){:target="_blank"}.

I’d love to make more of these obelisks and would welcome enquiries to [andysglass252@gmail.com](mailto:andysglass252@gmail.com). An obelisk typically costs between £200 and £400 plus transport, depending on the size, complexity and degree of work required.
