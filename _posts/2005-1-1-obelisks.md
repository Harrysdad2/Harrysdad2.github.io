The roofs of the houses we live in have a big heavy timber ridge beam that’s about 11”x 3” cross section. When lofts are converted, the beam is removed and replaced with a steel beam. 
I’ve always likes the stained glass art where glass is set into a large piece of driftwood and stood vertically in the ground. I thought that a length of this beam could be used with a piece of stained glass and be shaped (carved even) to be a little more interesting. I obtained a few lengths from local houses (with permission!) and set to work on making an obelisk.

A quick sketch and a sunny afternoon spent laying out lots of bits of glass led to a ‘rainbow’ panel. A few hours spent with an assortment of power tolls left me with an hole in the wood and some shaping around the edges. It’s amazing how much mess you can make with a sanding disc on an angle grinder!
The finished article sits in our garden where it provides a focal point and catches the late afternoon sun.

My second obelisk was made as payment to a good friend in exchange for her professional gardening/planting advice! For this one I chose to use a facetted jewel and create a ‘landscape’ in glass. This now sits in her gorgeous garden in north Leeds.

I decided to make a simplified rectangular obelisk to sell. This one now resides in a peaceful garden used by a therapy centre in Sheffield.

I’d love to make more of these obelisks and would welcome enquiries to [andysglass252@gmail.com](mailto:andysglass252@gmail.com)
