title: Suncatchers
---

Free-hanging pieces of stained glass are known as suncatchers. These vary from very small pieces to larger panels, like Alison's Owl & Sunflowers picture in the [Commissions section](https://andy.merckel.uk/commissions/){:target="_blank"}.The following is a selection of those done so far...

A simple Yorkshire Rose:

And, in the interests of equality, a Lancashire Rose:

A more complex rose, made as a present:

Any shape can be done, within reason!
