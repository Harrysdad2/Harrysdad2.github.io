# Mantis

The latest in the line of bugs is a praying mantis. I set copper tubes into the glass to take the legs which made using spring steel wire easy but made it harder to fix the legs in the correct orientation. However, the finished article looks suitably mantis-like! I'd love to try to emulate the work of Sean Goddard, [seangoddardinsects.com,](https://www.seangoddardinsects.com){:target="_blank"} but that will require far more skill and a kiln of my own!
