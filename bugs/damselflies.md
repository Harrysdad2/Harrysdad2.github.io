# Damselflies

Next came a set of damselflies. These have more glass in them but follow similar construction to the spider. The leaves are a length of old copper pipe, split and flattened before cutting to shape. They are weighed down with a rock and sway in the breeze. One of them lives in an exposed location in Saddleworth and had to have its wings reinforced to be able to stand up to the strong westerly winds!
