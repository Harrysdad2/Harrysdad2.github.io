# Fairy

This one is not strictly a bug, but this fairy body had some butterfly wings that weren't particularly attractive. I removed them (gently) and designed and built a set of wings based on those normally found on a cicada. Each pair of wings is mounted on a length of stainless steel wire and soldered onto the back of the fairy's body. The addition of three hanging loops (one on each of the main wings and one near her bum) allow her to be suspended 'in-flight'.
