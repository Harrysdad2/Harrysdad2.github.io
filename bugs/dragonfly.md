# Dragonfly

My first bug was a dragonfly, inspired by by a pair of blue glass nuggets that had been fused together. Using thin copper sheet and wire (re-purposed electrical wire) I fashioned a body and wings with the nuggets as eyes. It has a wingspan of about 300mm and was originally attached to a length of piano wire set into a concrete block so it could wobble in the breeze over our pond. The wire has been swapped recently and is fixed to decking by the pond to lift the dragonfly clear of some of the more exuberant planting!
