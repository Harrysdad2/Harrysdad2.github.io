# Spider

Bitten by the bug(!), I then made a spider in it's web. The fused glass body was made by a local lady who made jewellery. The legs were made of copper wire and thin copper sheet. The web was made out of electrical wire. The only maintenance to this little lady is an annual cutting back of the ivy to make sure she stays visible. She has a leg-span of approximately 150mm.
