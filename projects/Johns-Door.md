# A 1930's Door Panel

A fun project, this glass is in a 1930s door and had suffered over the years. At some point, one of the clear pieces of glass had been relaced in-situ and a life of the door being open and closed, along with the odd slam(!) had resulted in the lead displacing and the glass coming loose. The owner had resorted to gaffer tape to prevent further damage pending repair.

The owner removed the panel from the door, and placed a sheet of plywood in until it could be replaced. He had also carried out repairs on the door.

The replacement glass was a poor match to the rest of the clear glass so that piece was swapped out. The rest of the glass was in good condition. The panel was deconstructed, the glass cleaned and rebuilt using new lead. Two of the horizontal joints had new heavy-duty reinforcement place within the lead came.

The first picture below is the panel as presented and the second is it re-fitted to the door.
