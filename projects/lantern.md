# A Clarice Cliff Inspired Lantern

As you may have seen elsewhere, I love the patterns created on ceramics by Clarice Cliff in the 1930s. My very first peice was a panel aftet her 'Autumn' pattern and I have done several small suncatchers since then using both 'Autumn' and 'Crocuses'. 

This is one of the ubiquitous IKEA lanterns owned by millions of us. It's a simple task to remove the clear glass and insert alternatives.
The pattern is based on a mix of 'Autumn' and 'Poplars' both involving trees and idealised bushes. Poplars incorporates large four-petalled flowers. There is a good deal of artistic licence involved in adding clouds to create suitable break-lines in the glass to allow the design to work and, hopefully, flow. I tried to ensure that each panel flowed into its adjacent panels both with lines and colours.I had originally drawn this up in 2022 but only got round to building it in January 2024!

This picture shows the four panels with white paper behind to show the pattern:

This is a design I may repeat using opaque glasses, so that the pattern is illuminated without the inside being visible.
