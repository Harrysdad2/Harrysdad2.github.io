This is a hobby, but occasionally I put pieces of work on [Ebay.](https://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/harrysdad2/m.html){:target="_blank"} This funds new materials and lets me play with new ideas.

I am always happy to talk about something you may like, either related to something you’ve seen on these pages or to help realise an idea that you may have. Please be assured that if I think it is beyond my capabilities I will tell you!

I try to make my prices as realistic as possible. The cost of glass can vary enormously depending on colour, whether it is machine or hand made, patterns and finishes. Of course, the time taken to make an item is significant too. One of the bats below takes around 4 hours to make from start to finish. They really are hand made and unique!

Typically a small tiffany-style piece will be around £25. An obelisk will be between £200 and £300. Windows depend on the size and degree of work involved.

I’m always happy to discuss a project. Contact me on [andysglass252@gmail.com](mailto:andysglass252@gmail.com)
