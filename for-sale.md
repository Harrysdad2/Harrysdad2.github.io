# Stuff For Sale

{: .notice }
New shop under construction. Please check back soon.

This is a hobby, but I do have pieces of work for sale in my SumUp shop - link at the top of the page. This funds new materials and lets me play with new ideas. 

I try to make my prices as realistic as possible. The cost of glass can vary enormously depending on colour, whether it is machine or hand made, patterns and finishes. Of course, the time taken to make an item is significant too. A small suncatcher takes two to five hours to make from start to finish. The Liverpool FC crest took 20 hours. They really are hand made and unique!

Typically a small suncatcher will be £25 to £30 depending on complexity. Larger suncatchers and panels are likely to be £50 to £250. An obelisk will be between £200 and £500, see my [obelisks page](https://andy.merckel.uk/obelisks/){:target="_blank"}. Windows depend on the size and degree of work involved.

If a suncatcher shows as sold out, or you've seen something on the webpage that is not in the shop then contact me. I'm always happy to make to order, although you would need to allow a short time before it could be sent to you.

I’m always happy to discuss a project. See the [Commissions page](https://andy.merckel.uk/commissions/){:target="_blank"}. Contact me on [andysglass252@gmail.com](mailto:andysglass252@gmail.com).
