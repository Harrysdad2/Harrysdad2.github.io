I try to make my prices as realistic as possible. The cost of glass can vary enormously depending on colour, whether it is machine or hand made, patterns and finishes. Of course, the time taken to make an item is significant too. A small suncatcher takes two to five hours to make from start to finish. Larger ones can take considerably longer. They really are hand made and unique!

Typically a small suncatcher will be £25 to £35 depending on complexity, although a few of the very complex ones are a little more. See my [Small Suncatchers page](https://andy.merckel.uk/suncatchers/small.html){:target="_blank"}. Larger suncatchers and panels are likely to be £50 to £250. An obelisk will be between £250 and £700, see my [obelisks page](https://andy.merckel.uk/obelisks/){:target="_blank"}. Windows depend on the size and degree of work involved.

All of the small suncatchers are available to order and can be locally delivered, collected or posted at cost. Contact me on [andysglass252@gmail.com](mailto:andysglass252@gmail.com). If there is a subject you would like then let me know and I'll see what I can do! The Magpie, Koala, Panda, Rubber Duck and Windmill are all commissions.

I’m always happy to discuss a project. See the [Commissions page](https://andy.merckel.uk/commissions/){:target="_blank"}. Contact me on [andysglass252@gmail.com](mailto:andysglass252@gmail.com).
