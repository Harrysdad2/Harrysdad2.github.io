This is a hobby, but occasionally I put pieces of work on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/AndysGardenGlass){:target="_blank"}. This funds new materials and lets me play with new ideas. Current items include:

![Black Spider]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/spiderblack.jpg)

![Bat 1]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/bat1.jpg)

There area a few suncatchers now available. Take a look! [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/AndysGardenGlass){:target="_blank"}

I try to make my prices as realistic as possible. The cost of glass can vary enormously depending on colour, whether it is machine or hand made, patterns and finishes. Of course, the time taken to make an item is significant too. One of the bats above takes over 4 hours to make from start to finish. The Liverpool FC crest took 20 hours. They really are hand made and unique!

Typically a small tiffany-style piece will be around £25. A suncatcher will depend on size and complexity, but is likely to be £50 to £200. An obelisk will be between £200 and £400, see my [obelisks page](https://andy.merckel.uk/obelisks/){:target="_blank"}. Windows depend on the size and degree of work involved.

I’m always happy to discuss a project. See the [Commissions page](https://andy.merckel.uk/commissions/){:target="_blank"}. Contact me on [andysglass252@gmail.com](mailto:andysglass252@gmail.com). 

New:

I've put another obelisk together which is now on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/AndysGardenGlass){:target="_blank"}. The glass is about 200mm x 400mm and looks like this:
