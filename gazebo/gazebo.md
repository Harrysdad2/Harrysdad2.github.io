# Gazebo

We are lucky to have a large garden, albeit on a steep slope away from the house. 20 years ago I built a circular patio half way down the garden where the evening sun stays longest. However, being some distance from the house it didnâ€™t get a huge amount of use. In Spring 2018 I decided to build a wooden gazebo over it so we could have some shelter, light etc and could use it on those rare warm evenings.
