# Triangles

Having completed the gazebo it instantly became a great place to sit in the evenings. I decided to start filling up some of the ‘gaps’ with glass. On the five open sides there are triangles above the braces on each leg. I decided to do a variety of panels to fit them. Eight are now filled with two to go!

First up was a dragonfly using some brass filigree wings. This is a mixture of Tiffany and lead construction.

Next came a spider in her web. The web is leaded and the spider is cut from thin copper sheet and blacked.

We live in Yorkshire, so a simplified Yorkshire Rose seemed appropriate, with leaded construction.

And another variation on the Merckel crest.

The fish is fused glass (with no lead) and was designed by my daughter, Katie. It was made in evening classes where I had access to a kiln.

Triangle six is a gecko. This used the same techniques as the fish and sits on the opposite side of the arch.

Having asked Katie to design a couple more she came up with sun and moon designs. These were constructed using the Tiffany technique with a lead frame.
