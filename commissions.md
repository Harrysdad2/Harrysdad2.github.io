I am always happy to talk about something you may like, either related to something youâ€™ve seen on these pages or to help realise an idea that you may have. Please be assured that if I think it is beyond my capabilities I will tell you!

Details of a few recent commissions are outlined below. I like to get as much information as possible about what a customer would like, where the item is to go, particular colours etc. We'll agree a price at this point and a deposit will be paid. I'll produce sketch designs and swap notes making changes as we go. If there are any significant changes during this process we may agree a revised price. Once we have a design agreed then I'll draw up the working plan and start to gather glass. This is either from stock or I'll buy in particular pieces as required. I will share a set of photos as work progresses so that the customer can follow the process. Once complete we arrange delivery which may be in person or using a courierwith the remaining payment made on despatch.

### Pam's Obelisk



### Alison's Owl & Sunflowers Panel

Alison had seen my work because she works with my aunt! She contacted me about making a picture in glass as a present for her daughter. The brief was for sunflowers, an owl and possibly a rabbit. We agreed that it would be a panel that could be hung in a window and I drew up an idea which developed to a design a bit bigger than an A4 sheet of paper.

For this commission I opted to makes the sunflowers out of five pieces of glass, the centre and four edge pieces. The petals would be painted on using a craft glass paint that is baked to make it permanent. This is a technique that does not require a kiln, so is available to anyone with access to a normal oven! The paint, once cured and baked, is permanent, although I doubt it would last for centuries like the painted elements that are fused intot he glass, as you see in church windows. I started by testing a flower head as below:

I agreed with Alison that the centre should be a darker glass, so constuction started using a deeper shade of amber. As part of the painting process I also added eyes to the owl and the rabbit.

On this piece I foiled glass as cutting progressed and pinned then soldered sections into place to ensure a good fit. Once the centre pf the panel was completed I added a border using 'H' section lead with 'C' section to the outside. The hanging loops are made out of silver-plated copper wire loops. The stem is passed through a small hole in the lead, bent and soldered into place.

Once the lead was in place the solder lines were beaded and cleaned thoroughly. A black patina was applied the panel was polished before a chain was attached.

The final three images of this piece show it on the light-box, with light on the front and against natural light in the garden. They properly illustrate how the glass changes and provides constant interest.
