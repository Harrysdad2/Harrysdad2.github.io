I am always happy to talk about something you may like, either related to something youâ€™ve seen on these pages or to help realise an idea that you may have. Please be assured that if I think it is beyond my capabilities I will tell you!

Contact me on [andysglass252@gmail.com](mailto:andysglass252@gmail.com). 

Details of a few recent commissions are outlined below to give you an idea of the process that I like to follow. It is vital that we both understand what is expected and that you get what you want.

I like to get as much information as possible about what a customer would like, where the item is to go, particular colours etc. We'll agree a price (plus delivery) at this point and a deposit will be paid. I'll produce sketch designs and swap notes making changes as we go. If there are any significant changes during this process we may agree a revised price. Once we have a design agreed then I'll draw up the working plan and start to gather glass. This is either from stock or I'll buy in particular pieces as required. I will share a set of photos as work progresses so that the customer can follow the process. Once complete the remaining payment is made and we arrange delivery. This may be in person or using a courier.

## Pam's Obelisk

Pam found this website and contacted me about commissioning an obelisk. Pam had a very clear idea of what she would like so creating a design was relatively straightforward and, other than a change in shape (to give the obelisk a sloped top) involved very little adjustment.

A fundamental part of this design were the circles of textured clear glass. I leaded these as soon as they were cut using some soft wire to hold the lead in place so they could be soldered, ensuring a perfect circle. Once glass choices had been made, this panel went together quickly and was great fun. The final part of the process was to cement the panel and then clean and polish everything.

As shown on the Obelisk page, the timber was planed, cut to size and I filled any cracks with epoxy resin. The recess for the glass was made using a router and was cut from both sides - much measuring and checking! The timber was finished using a water-repellant product that does not change the colour or texture of the timber. The glass was set into place using putty and a timber bead nailed in place using stainless steel pins.

This was sent to it's new home near Peterborough using a courier collect and deliver service. Clearly it had to be properly packed and many cardboard boxes were re-purposed in doing this!

Pam was very pleased with the obelisk...

## Alison's Owl & Sunflowers Panel

Alison had seen my work because she works with my aunt! She contacted me about making a picture in glass as a present for her daughter. The brief was for sunflowers, an owl and possibly a rabbit. We agreed that it would be a panel that could be hung in a window and I drew up an idea which developed to a design a bit bigger than an A4 sheet of paper. 

![Owl Designs]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/owl sketches.jpg)

For this commission I opted to makes the sunflowers out of five pieces of glass, the centre and four edge pieces. The petals would be painted on using a craft glass paint that is baked to make it permanent. This is a technique that does not require a kiln, so is available to anyone with access to a normal oven! The paint, once cured and baked, is permanent, although I doubt it would last for centuries like the painted elements that are fused intot he glass, as you see in church windows. I started by testing a flower head as below:

I agreed with Alison that the centre should be a darker glass, so construction started using a deeper shade of amber. As part of the painting process I also added eyes to the owl and the rabbit.

Once the glass was cut I applied the foil then pinned and soldered sections into place checking and adjusting fit as I went. Once the centre of the panel was completed I added a border of textured clear glass using 'H' section lead with 'C' section to the outside. The hanging loops are made out of silver-plated copper wire loops. The stem of the loop is passed through a small hole in the lead, bent and soldered into place.

With the lead in place the solder lines were beaded and cleaned thoroughly. A black patina was applied and the panel was polished before a hanging chain was attached.

The final three images of this piece show it on the light-box, with light on the front and against natural light in the garden. They properly illustrate how the glass changes and provides constant interest.

I handed over this panel in person when we met at a point midway between our homes. I'm happy to report that Alison is very pleased with her commission and it now resides in the South Lakes, near Morecambe Bay.

I have also made/restored windows. Check out the [door set.](https://andy.merckel.uk/victorianwindow/){:target="_blank"}
