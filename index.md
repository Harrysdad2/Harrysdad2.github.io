### Stained Glass Artist from Leeds



This site is a gallery of glass creations made since 1996. There are a variety of windows and suncatchers, tiffany-style or lead construction and some with a combination of both. There are even a few fused glass pieces!

Latest pieces are on Instagram at [@andys.glass](https://www.instagram.com/andys.glass){:target="_blank"} and my Facebook page [Andy's Glass](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100088442906461){:target="_blank"}
