# Andy's Glass

### Stained Glass Artist from Leeds

This site is a gallery of glass creations made since 1996. There are a variety of windows and suncatchers, tiffany-style or lead construction and some with a combination of both. There are even a few fused glass pieces!

This new site is under construction! Some content may be missing so please be patient while I catch up :).
